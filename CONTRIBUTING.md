## Contributing
Here's some things you could do if you want to help the project.

Thank you for contributing!

### Bug reports
When submitting a bug report, you should include all the necessary steps for
reproducing the bug. Describe in detail the expected behavior and the observed
behavior. Do not submit bug reports about odd behavior caused by using the
provided utilities to break the game.

### Feedback
If you want to submit feedback about possible improvements or feature requests,
include a detailed description of your proposed changes, how they should be
designed, how they will fit in with the current design, and possibly how they
should be implemented. Do not submit suggestions that are too subjective to be
considered improvements.

### Code
If you want to fix a bug or implement a feature yourself, feel free to make a
development fork. Before you start working on a feature, you may first want to
submit an issue where you describe the feature you want to add, to be sure that
such a feature would be accepted. There's no canonical style guide for this
project, but you should adhere to the style used in the rest of the code. Code
that doesn't meet the current quality standard will be rejected. When your code
is ready, send a pull request. Your code will be reviewed, and possibly merged
with the master branch.
